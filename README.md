## Developer, feminist, gamer, geek

I enjoy spending my evenings reading, playing games and watching films.

I've been coding websites ever since I got my first internet-enabled computer in 1998. I taught myself to code using library books, and started out by hand-coding HTML in textpad.

I love making pretty and useful things that people can enjoy; whether it be websites, photographs or FIMO models.
