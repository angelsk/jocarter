## EXPERIENCE

### Director, Consultant Tech Lead and Principle Software Engineer, Jo Carter Ltd (April 2019 - present)

### Consultant Senior PHP Developer at J Sainsbury, Daemon Solutions (May 2019 – December 2019)

Via the technology consultancy firm Daemon Solutions, I worked with the Sainsbury's Food to Order team on their website, which consisted of a collection of Symfony 4 microservices (used by their Node and React applications) and a legacy Symfony 3 monolith.  I was involved in integration with internal (third party) APIs, logging and auditing, code gardening, documentation, planning and deprecation of old code. This included upgrading the monolith to the latest version of PHP and Symfony 3; and rolling out a whole range of code improvement tools across the microservices (PHPStan, Infection/ Mutation), in addition to improving overall coverage and code  quality. I really enjoyed collaborating with the team, including helping mentor an apprentice developer.

### Freelance Senior Software Developer, Wellcome Trust (March 2018 - December 2018)

Part of the team responsible for the development of the Explorify website (science for primary school teachers). During my time there we refactored the majority of the codebase (PHP, frontend and the database), added additional automation for testing and QA, and upgraded the site from Symfony 3 to 4. Day to day work included code reviews, adding new features, cleaning data, maintenance and as much code gardening as I could squeeze in. I also contributed back to several of the open source bundles we used.

I was brought in as a full stack developer, so I also worked with the team on adding automated testing to the frontend using Chai, Mocha, Cypress and Nightwatch (with Browserstack); and helped refactor the frontend code (with an emphasis on accessibly and UX) and developed new features (using Webpack, Javascript and SCSS/CSS). We also added in a stats dashboard, split testing (A/B), tracking and monitoring so we could see how our new features improved the user experience.

### Consultant Engineering Manager, Onlicar (November 2017 - March 2018)

Fifty PIFs was brought in to evaluate the technical process at Onlicar and help streamline it.  I worked with the existing team to add in monitoring for their services, update the documentation to understand how all the systems worked together, and introduced the developers to automated testing. I also code reviewed and QA’d new python code for a system upgrade by our internal team.

### Engineering Manager, MOO (June 2017 - November 2017)

I practiced both test-driven and domain-driven development, using PHPSpec, Behat and Symfony 2/3.

My team and I mainly worked on internal projects, which included developing a custom CRM; a custom solution for optimising the quoting pipeline for our 2D, 3D and design departments; an applicant tracking system with accompanying candidate microsite; an online annual review system for HR; and other internal integration projects. We also worked on a number of large external client projects, mainly on integrations and APIs for mobile applications and games, with some branching into VR.

I was directly responsible for managing several members of the development team, including coaching, mentoring and career path development. I was heavily involved in the recruitment process for new team members; through tech tests, interviews and hiring. I was part of the diversity and inclusion network within the Mill; and took part in many training courses (detailed below).
