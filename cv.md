   &nbsp; &nbsp; Worked with several Symfony systems (3.4, 4, and 5) on multiple projects at MyBuilder. Involved in both upgrading legacy code and writing new functionality, both working solo and pairing with other developers.

   &nbsp; &nbsp; These included: MyBuilderPlus (event-driven backend, CQRS, Symfony 5 with messenger component, DDD, Docker, Lambda and Bref; and a Symfony+Twig frontend consumer site); The MyBuilder site (Symfony 3.4), with additional microservices e.g Push Notifications, (Symfony 5 + Bref); and the Quote Tool (Symfony 4 API Write Model for a React Client app, with events and commands).

  &nbsp; &nbsp; Via the technology consultancy firm Daemon Solutions, I worked with the Sainsbury’s Food to Order team on their website, which consisted of a collection of Symfony 4 microservices (used by their Node and React applications) and a legacy Symfony 3 monolith. I was involved in integration with internal (third party) APIs, logging and auditing, code gardening, documentation, planning and deprecation of old code. This included upgrading the monolith to the latest version of PHP and Symfony 3; and rolling out a whole range of code improvement tools across the microservices (PHPStan, Infection/ Mutation), in addition to improving overall coverage and code quality. I really enjoyed collaborating with the team, including helping mentor an apprentice developer.

Day to day work included code reviews, adding new features, cleaning data, maintenance and as much code gardening as I could squeeze in. I also contributed back to several of the open source bundles we used.

  &nbsp; &nbsp; I was brought in as a full-stack developer, so I also worked with the team on adding automated testing using Chai, Mocha, Cypress and Nightwatch (with Browserstack); and helped refactor the frontend code (with an emphasis on accessibly and UX) and developed new features (using Webpack, Javascript and SCSS/CSS). We also added in a stats dashboard, split testing (A/B), tracking and monitoring so we could see how our new features improved the user experience.
